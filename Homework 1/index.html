    <p> Hello, my name is Sam McEnery.  Im from Geneva, Illinois and am a proud Midwesterner. Currently, I'm a senior at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul Minnesota.  I am a Computer Science major and have been for the past 4 years of my attendance.
    Over the years in College I've learned a great deal about Computer Science and I hope to continue the journey.  When I graduate I plan on getting a job in the tech industry based around cyber security or perhaps something different such as a sports statistician.</p>
