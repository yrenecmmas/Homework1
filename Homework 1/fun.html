        <p>The picture above is my Highschool team winning the Illinois State Combined division Championship. Throughout Highschool I was an avid hockey player, therefore sports has always been an important part of my life.  When the water freezes over in the winter playing pond hockey is one of my favorite things to do.  I am also an avid watcher of the NFL and am truly fascinated by sports statistics. I'm always excited for sunday to come so I can watch as many football games as I can.</p>
